# Validation Requirements Reference

See full requirements in [docs/Proyecto 2_3307_v2.pdf](mdc:docs/Proyecto 2_3307_v2.pdf)

## Requirement #1: Error File Generation (5 points)
- Create numbered copy of HTML file with `.txt` extension
- Format: `0001`, `0002`, etc. (4-digit line numbers)
- List errors below problematic lines with error number, line reference, and description

## Requirement #2: JavaScript Identifiers (10 points)
- Must start with letter, underscore, or Unicode letter
- Can contain letters, digits, underscores, Unicode characters
- Cannot contain spaces or special chars (-, +, *, /, etc.)
- Case-sensitive
- Cannot be JavaScript reserved words
- Must appear after `let` or `var` keywords

## Requirement #3: Constants (10 points)
- Name follows identifier rules (same as #2)
- Must use `const` keyword
- Must assign value immediately (cannot be uninitialized)
- Cannot be reassigned
- Must be declared before use
- Cannot be declared after `var`/`let` in same scope

## Requirement #4: Assignments (15 points)
- Validate basic assignment (`=`)
- Validate compound assignments (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`))
- Validate chain assignments (`a = b = c = 42`)
- Type checking: All variables on right must match type of variable on left

## Requirement #5: Function Definitions (15 points)
- Must use `function` keyword
- Must have function name (follows identifier rules)
- Must have parentheses `()`
- Must have body in curly braces `{ }`
- Body must contain at least one statement
- Parameters must be valid (follow identifier rules)
- Functions must be within `<script></script>` tags

## Requirement #6: Data Input (10 points)
- Validate `document.getElementById("id").value` calls
- Must verify that the ID inside quotes corresponds to an actual HTML element
- The HTML element with that `id` attribute must exist

## Requirement #7: Data Output (10 points)
- Validate `document.getElementById("id").innerHTML = value` syntax
- Must verify the ID inside quotes exists as an HTML element
- Right side of `=` can be assumed correct

## Requirement #8: HTML Structure (25 points - Most Important!)
- All tags must have opening and closing tags (except `<!DOCTYPE html>`)
- `<!DOCTYPE html>` must be exactly as shown
- `<!DOCTYPE html>` must be at the very beginning
- Required structure: `<!DOCTYPE html>` → `<html>` → `<head>` → `<body>` → `</body>` → `</html>`

## Implementation Notes

- Each validator should be a separate class in `validators/` package
- Validators traverse the AST independently
- All errors collected in `ErrorCollector` before reporting
- Line numbers come from AST nodes: `node.getLineNumber()`
