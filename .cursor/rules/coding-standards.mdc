# Coding Standards

## Java Conventions

- Use Java 21 (as specified in [nbproject/project.properties](mdc:nbproject/project.properties))
- Follow standard Java naming conventions:
  - Classes: PascalCase
  - Methods/Variables: camelCase
  - Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
  - Packages: lowercase

## Documentation

- All public classes and methods must have JavaDoc comments
- Include `@author eduardo` in class-level JavaDoc
- Document parameters, return values, and exceptions
- Explain complex logic with inline comments

## Error Handling

- Use [ErrorCollector](mdc:src/errors/ErrorCollector.java) for all error reporting
- Never print errors directly to console
- Include line numbers in all error messages
- Format errors as: `"Error [number]: [description] at line [line]"`

## Project Constraints

- **No third-party libraries** - All code must be self-contained
- **Portable execution** - Program must run independently on any machine
- **NetBeans IDE** - Use NetBeans in character mode (not graphical)
- **Modular design** - Use functions/classes for organization

## File Organization

- One public class per file
- Package structure matches directory structure
- Keep related classes in the same package
- Use meaningful package names: `lexer`, `parser`, `ast`, `validators`, `errors`, `utils`

## Code Quality

- Fix all linter errors before committing
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Keep methods focused on a single responsibility
- Avoid deep nesting (max 3-4 levels)
